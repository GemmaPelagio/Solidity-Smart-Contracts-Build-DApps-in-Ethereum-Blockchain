ASSIGNMENT First Smart Contract
Now go in httpsremix.ethereum.org and type your first smart contract. Make sure you type this yourself and not just copy-paste it. This way you will learn more how to code in solidity. Also be sure that when you add messages to test you type them in quotes like this - message

UPDATE For anyone who wants to use this in the newer version of solidity ^0.5.1 use the code below. The difference is that we need to specify that our strings are memory variables explicitly

pragma solidity ^0.5.1;
 
contract Messenger{
    address owner;
    string[] messages;
    
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function add(string memory newMessage) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        messages.push(newMessage);
    }
    
    function count() view public returns(uint){
        return messages.length;
    }
    
    function getMessages(uint index) view public returns(string memory){
        return messages[index];
    }
}
PREVIOUS For anyone who wants to test in in ^0.4.24

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
 
contract Messenger{
    address owner;
    string[] messages;
    
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function add(string newMessage) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        messages.push(newMessage);
    }
    
    function count() view public returns(uint){
        return messages.length;
    }
    
    function getMessages(uint index) view public returns(string){
        return messages[index];
    }
}
