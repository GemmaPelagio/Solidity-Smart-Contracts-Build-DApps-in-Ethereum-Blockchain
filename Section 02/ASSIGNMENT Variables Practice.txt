ASSIGNMENT Variables Practice
Now, go to httpsremix.ethereum.org and copy the contracts below

Try out what you will get when you deploy each contracts and call the variables. This way you will get familiour with the Remix IDE and have a good practice.

Remember as aways to write the contracts yourself just by looking and not copy-pasting them in Remix. It is better to write on your own so you can get used to  catching typing errors that you can make.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
 
contract VariableExamples{
    bool public switchedOn = true;
    address public owner = msg.sender;
    uint8 public number = 8;
    bytes32 public awesome1 = Solidity is awesome!;
    string public awesome2 = Solidity is awesome!;
}
Below we have the example of overflow and underflow of a number. It is a common pitfall in programming so be aware of it and avoid it at all costs.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract OverflowAndUnderflow {
    function overflow() public pure returns(uint256){
        uint256 max = 2256-1;
        return max +1;
    }
 
    function underflow() public pure returns(uint256){
        uint256 min = 0;
        return min-1;
    }
}
